# Custom-APB-UART-IP
This project implements a custom APB-wrapped UART IP with transmitter, receiver, baud generator, and register file, designed for SoC integration. It supports configurable baud rates, memory-mapped control/status registers, and includes self-checking testbenches with verified simulation results.
